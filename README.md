# Overview
This is my learning in creating microservices in spring boot with several technologies as `kafka`, `Eureka`, `Config Server` etc...

# Pre-requisites
1. Java 17
2. Intellij idea
3. docker desktop

# Usage
Run the services in order
1. discovery-server
2. docker-compose
3. all services
4. api-gateway

# Run
In root folder there is a `.run` folder you can import in intellij idea to run all microservices at once.

Otherwise, run services as described in usage section

# Info
